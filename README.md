# PacmanGame
A slightly different version of the classical Pacman that I created to practice JAVA and JApplets.

You can use the buttons on the JApplet, or the Up/Down/Left/Right buttons on your keyboard to move Pacman. If you die, you can press the "Reset" button to start the game over again.

The differences between this Pacman, and the Pacman that most people are used to playing is that there are no walls for Pacman to traverse. Instead he/it can move freely in the grid to try and get the yellow boxes and win the game. The ghosts can only kill Pacman if Pacman moves and occupies the same space as ghost at that time (so if the ghost moves on Pacman while staying still, then Pacman will not die).

I also added 2 new buttons to the game: "God-mode" and "Freeze". God-mode makes Pacman invincible to any of the ghosts, so you can win the game in as little time as possible. Freeze merely puts Pacman into a "frozen" state where the ghosts can no longer attack him, so that you can leave the game, come back at a later point and pick it up where you left off.
